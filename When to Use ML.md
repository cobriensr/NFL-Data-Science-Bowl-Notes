##### Simple Analytics (No ML):

- Formation width/depth calculations
- Basic motion detection
- Player counting by position
- Distance to line of scrimmage
- Time to snap calculations

##### ML Needed:

- Play type prediction
- Route pattern recognition
- Formation clustering
- Success probability estimation
- Complex motion pattern analysis
